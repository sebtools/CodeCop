I just thought I would write a few notes on my thoughts in making this.

This application is not meant to be OO, but rather follow a more service-based approach (as per my personal preference).

Code Organization:
- "/": display code that is specific to this project (all original).
- "/sys/": logic that is specific to this project (all original except colorCode method).
- "/sys/custom/": custom code for a rule will be stored here (make sure write permissions are enabled for this folder)
- "/sys/tags/": pre-existing open-source code for code-creation.
- "/sys/types/": The code for each rule type. If you wanted to add a new rule type, you would start by adding a CFC here (then change the rule edit form)
- "/com/": CFCs that I use on many projects (all open source).
- "/layouts/": layout code.
	- CFAmin7.cfc: code used by pages in the CF Admin for CF7 and above.
	- CFAmin6.cfc: code used by pages in the CF Admin for CF6.
	- Default.cfc: code used by pages outside of the CF Admin.
	- layout.cfc: the parent layout component to be extended by the others.
	- All others: modified versions of common layout components.
- "/lib/": JavaScript and CSS for my custom tags
- "/sebtags/": my open-source custom tags

The code specific to this application is limited to the root and sys folders.

Guiding principles in my coding:
1. A thing should be what it seems to be.
2. Consistency of user experience
3. Strive for elegant simplicity.
