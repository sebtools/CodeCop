Installation Instructions:

You can install CodeCop either in the CF Admin or on its own.



-Install in ColdFusion Administrator:

1. unzip the file
2. Copy the CodeCop folder into the ColdFusion administrator folder /CFIDE/administrator/
3.
	If extensioncustom.cfm exists in /CFIDE/administrator/
		Copy the contents of extensioncustom.cfm to the bottom of that file
	If extensioncustom.cfm does not exist in /CFIDE/administrator/
		Copy extensioncustom.cfm to /CFIDE/administrator/
4. Make sure the root CodeCop folder and CodeCop/sys/custom/ are writable (not generally a worry on Windows)
   (CodeCop saves settings to the config.cfm file in the root - you can optionally set these manually)
   (CodeCop saves custom code to the CodeCop/sys/custom/ folder. It is essential that this is writable)
5. Log in to the ColdFusion administrator, go to "Custom Extensions" and click "CodeCop"
6. Choose a database and hit submit
   (CodeCop will install itself on the chosen database. All tables have a prefix of "chk", which should prevent naming conflicts)
   (Database support includes any supported by DataMgr.cfc - view about.cfm for current list)
   (supported as of this writing: Access,Derby,MS SQL,MySQL,PostGreSQL)
7. Start using CodeCop.
